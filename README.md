##  Color Palette

I used the site colorhunt.co to bring together a colour pallet for the base of the website. The choice of the monocrhomatic pallet with light colour a age friendly website.

## Fonts 

I've chosen "Paytone One" as the font for my website as it is a very appealing font and easy to read. My sorcce for the font was Google fonts.

# Testing
 
  - I've tested to play the quiz in different browers and different devices.
  - Ive had a few problem with a the "Go Again" button and I could not understand how to make the  button work. I spoke to Spence Barriball, my mentor, and he was able to guide me and point me to the correct direction.
  - When I first ran my JavaScript code on the JShint I got sever l warning "	'const'('let') is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz)." That was easily solver with a comment placed at the very start of the code (/*jshint esversion: 6 */.)

# Deployment 

For the website development I used Gitpod as served as the local repository and IDE and GitHUb served as the remote repository.

The following steps were followed to maintain version control;

- I created a repository on GitHub and named it 'quiz_website' 
- I then signed in to Gitpod and opened a new workspace via the repository name 'quiz_website'
- I created the pages, folders and files on GitPod
- I saved my work on GitPod at regular intervals and pushed it to GitHub to keep it safe

This is the process I followed having completing each significant section of code, I typed the following into the terminal:
- git add . (This added the work to git)
- git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE" (this to update my local repo)
- git push (This pushed the work to GitHub)

I followed the below steps on GitHub to deploy the website. 

- Go to repository and select 'settings'. 
- Under the 'Github pages@ section, click on the live link. 
- On "Source", select "Branch: main' for Branch and click save.
- The website is now published on GitHub Pages and the link is provided on the same section
